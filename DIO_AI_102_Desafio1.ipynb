       "'11 Practical Ways to Bring Side Income as a Developer 💰 - DEV Community\\nSkip to content\\nNavigation menu\\nSearch\\nPowered by\\nSearch\\nAlgolia\\nSearch\\nLog in\\nCreate account\\nDEV Community\\nClose\\nAdd reaction\\nLike\\nUnicorn\\nExploding Head\\nRaised Hands\\nFire\\nJump to Comments\\nSave\\nMore...\\nCopy link\\nCopy link\\nCopied to Clipboard\\nShare to X\\nShare to LinkedIn\\nShare to Facebook\\nShare to Mastodon\\nReport Abuse\\nAnmol Baranwal\\nfor\\nOpire\\nPosted on\\nNov 20\\n11 Practical Ways to Bring Side Income as a Developer 💰\\n# programming\\n# beginners\\n# opensource\\n# productivity\\nIt’s always smart not to rely on just one source of income.\\nBringing in side income might seem tough at first, but for developers, it’s surprisingly easier than you think.\\nThis post briefly outlines 21 practical ways to build some side revenue as a developer.\\nThis guide will help you build a sustainable income.\\n1. Solve open source bounties.\\nThis is one of the most underrated ways and is often neglected.\\nIf you\\'re a decent coder, you can earn from $200 to $10k with a single pull request.\\nThat\\'s the power of open source bounties.\\nYou can find those bounties on\\nOpire . They are moving towards the vision that anyone can make a living from open source.\\nAs a developer, you can also build credibility and showcase it in your portfolio because you\\'re solving real-world problems people are willing to pay for.\\nMany reputed organizations like Cal.com use these bounties to speed up their projects.\\nEven the subscriptions that Opire launched recently are very profitable. Developers receive 100% of the rewards regardless. No tricks in that!\\nIf you\\'re confused about where to get started, I recommend reading the\\nofficial docs .\\nBy the way, Opire is completely open source so it builds more trust. You can star the repository and join the\\ndiscord community\\nto show support!\\nStar Opire ⭐️\\n2. Technical writing for guest posts.\\nA lot of companies accept guest writers to publish content on their blogs.\\nAll you need is the ability to create content around their product and possibly with different tech stacks.\\nThe work is remote with a high pay rate and you reach more people (grow your network and secure future work).\\nThe main thing is to communicate technical concepts in a way that is understandable to different audiences.\\nIf you\\'re struggling to get accepted into any of these programs, start by writing your own posts and publishing them to popular platforms like here on DEV, Devdojo, Medium or Hackernoon. This will build up your writing skills and help you show your knowledge to potential companies.\\nOne decent website is\\nwhopaystechnicalwriters\\nwhere you will find content agencies, publications and community writer programs. You can filter based on your tech stack.\\nSome other companies that pay high for quality posts:\\nAirbyte\\n- $900 per article.\\nCircleCI\\n- $350 - $600 per article.\\nDigitalOcean\\n- $400 per article.\\nLinode\\n- $400 per article.\\nAppSignal\\n- $300 per article.\\nAuth0\\n- $450 per article.\\nCorrelium\\n- $500 - $1500 per article.\\nLambdaTest\\n- $200 per article.\\nTutorialspoint\\n- $500 per article.\\nA great list of 84 such websites was put together\\xa0by\\nJulia here on Devto .\\n3. Participate in Hackathons.\\nYes, I know. There is no guaranteed payout in this case.\\nBut in the worst case, you will have a decent project in your portfolio which can help you land better opportunities.\\nCoding competitions are happening remotely all the time. These are usually sponsored by companies that pay out cash prizes to the winners.\\nSome of the decent websites where you can find the best hackathons to participate in:\\nMLH Global Hackathons\\n- The best place to find remote and in-person events.\\nDevpost\\n- The prizes can get upto $170k.\\nDevto challenges\\n- Mini hackathons on this platform that allow you to build in public.\\nKaggle\\n- For Data Science and Machine Learning competitions.\\nDevfolio\\n- another great place to find hackathons. They also offer a program to connect talented developers with startups.\\nUnstop\\n- all kinds of competitions including no-code events.\\nHackathons are a great way of meeting new people and learning new stuff, plus they\\'re just a lot of fun!\\nWhen I was in college, I participated in around 100+ competitions combined on Unstop and Devfolio.\\n4. Make digital products.\\nCreating and marketing digital products like guides, website templates, plugins or courses can help you build decent passive income.\\nThe best part? It needs very little maintenance and these products can be sold at any point in the future.\\nThe only thing that is required is to create value that meets market demands. Plus, you should be able to market these otherwise it makes no sense to create it.\\nPopular platforms for selling digital products:\\nGumRoad \\xa0- the best platform which includes subscriptions to email (10% flat fee)\\nCreative Market\\n- For design assets and themes\\nAppSumo \\xa0- Code, apps, extensions, templates, courses and more.\\nThemeForest\\n- For selling WordPress themes and website templates. You will become an Envato Market Author in the process.\\nThis one might be tricky because it\\'s tough to find a proper market fit but the more value you create, the better is the chance that people would be interested in your product.\\n5. Build a SAAS - Indie Hacking.\\nThis is my favorite among the list and for obvious reasons.\\nBuilding a Software as a Service (SaaS) startup can be very useful, both financially and professionally as a developer.\\n🎯 What is Indie Hacking?\\nIt is the process of building and selling a product independently, without the support of a large organization or team.\\nIndie hacking can be challenging and you will have to do everything.\\xa0But as some say good will goes a long way.\\nThere are many popular Indie Hackers like Tibo and Marc who have made more than $1M. In the process, they have built a huge audience.\\nTrust me, it\\'s the best way to grow but you need to play the long game.\\nTwo popular reads that I recommend checking out:\\nI’ve been indie hacking for a few months. Here’s what I learned\\nby Tamerlan.\\nA guide to Indie Hacking\\nby Rameerez.\\n$29 paid guide by levelsio that you can check out:\\nThe Indie Hacker Handbook .\\nIf you\\'re able to pull this off, it\\'s one of the best revenue models you can get.\\n6. User Testing.\\nCompanies developing production-level apps rely on user feedback to improve their products and that’s where user testing services step in.\\nYou can spend 10–30 minutes testing a website or app, sharing your feedback or completing a survey and getting paid for your effort.\\nWhile this isn’t exclusive to developers, your tech knowledge gives you an edge over others. You can complete tasks faster, provide decent feedback and earn much faster than the average user.\\nIn the process, you will learn the workflow and it might be useful for you if you are building your own app.\\nSome of the websites you can check out:\\nTrymata \\xa0- Earn up to $10 per website or app test\\nUser Testing \\xa0- Pays via PayPal, requires screen share and/or webcam access during the test session. Earn about $10 per test, with longer or live sessions paying up to $50 for some tests.\\nUserlytics \\xa0- Earn between $5 and $50 depending on the difficulty and length of the testing session.\\nIntelliZoom \\xa0- Earn between $2 and $10 per 10-minute study. Paid via PayPal with a 3-5 day delay.\\nTestingTime \\xa0- Option for in-person or video call tests. Less regular, but longer testing sessions. Lower paying than alternatives, when you take into account the delay between sessions.\\nuTest\\n- $10 to $100+ per test depending upon session\\'s requirements.\\nRespondent\\n- You can also check this if you are interested in research work.\\nTo be honest, it\\'s repeated work so it is more useful for devs who love testing new apps.\\n7. Freelancing.\\nThis is one of the most popular ways of sustainable income for developers.\\nBut it\\'s very saturated in my experience and income can be very unstable because finding clients is tough. You will need to build a reputation and manage your finances accordingly.\\nIt can heavily vary based on your niche, platform and your experience.\\nSome of the popular platforms for developer gigs you can check out:\\nFiverr\\n- Kind of a huge marketplace, great for developers who are just starting out in freelancing. Ideal for very specific services.\\nContra\\n- You will be an Independent expert that helps companies because a lot of them like Framer hire from here. Plus, it\\'s 100% commission free so you won\\'t pay any charges. Please note that I\\'ve included my referral but it won\\'t give me any revenue, so feel free to join using this.\\nUpwork\\n- Upwork has a concept of connects and is generally for experienced developers. You can get long-term contracts and higher-paying jobs here. Suitable for those who prefer to work on more significant projects.\\nPeople per Hour\\n- This platform is good for developers in the European market. It emphasizes local business connections and offers a good balance between short-term and long-term projects.\\nPeoplePerHour\\n- Offers hourly and fixed-price projects.\\nToptal\\n- This is another platform for experienced developers with higher-paying offers.\\nI don\\'t prefer platforms that require investment. For instance, we need to buy connects on Upwork (once the limited ones are used) and it offers no such guarantee of any return.\\nMy suggestion would be to directly reach out to potential customers and work for them. It will make you feel better and stand out from the noise on the platforms.\\n8. Newsletters.\\nEmail newsletters and subscription-based RSS feeds have grown huge these recent years.\\nAll you need is a little bit of experience in your niche and the ability to write properly.\\nDevelopers need to be updated so they always love reading about new stuff especially if it includes your experience.\\nIn the process, you will build up a large (and very valuable) subscriber base and will be able to offer advertisements during your newsletters. A lot of creators do the same especially since it creates more value.\\nOr you can charge a smaller number of users to receive your updates.\\nConsole\\nis a sample newsletter that has around 30k+ subscribers.\\nThey send 2-3 of the most interesting dev tools every week\\nPopular platforms that you should check out:\\nSubstack\\nBeehiiv\\nConvertKit\\nSteady\\nButtonDown\\nGhost\\nIt\\'s important to take things one at a time, so research and choose one platform that might fit your needs. Substack and Beehiiv might be great choices.\\n9. Grants and open source internships.\\nThere are grants and corporate sponsorships available across different fields like open source, innovation, DeFi and even AI. These funds are basically to support your living expenses for a short duration while you work on a particular project.\\nIt\\'s similar to open source internships.\\nSome of the ones you should definitely check out:\\nGoogle Summer of Code (GSoC) \\xa0- Global program for developers (other than students can also apply now) to contribute to open source projects, with stipends typically ranging from $1500 to $3300. Became very popular in recent years.\\nGoogle Season of Docs\\n- Technical writers contribute to open source projects. Participating projects receive between $5,000 and $15,000 grants which are then distributed to contributors, usually via Open Collective.\\nGitCoin \\xa0- A crowdfunding platform that funds open source projects, particularly in Ethereum and Web3. Funding varies based on community support.\\nOutreachy \\xa0- Provides three-month internships for underrepresented groups in technology, with stipends typically around $5,500.\\nMozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) \\xa0- Grants for open source software development, particularly for projects that align with Mozilla\\'s mission.\\nThe Linux Foundation Grants \\xa0- Offers various grants and fellowships for developers working on Linux Foundation projects.\\nKnight Foundation \\xa0- Offers grants for tech projects that promote quality journalism. Grant amounts vary widely based on project scope.\\nNumFOCUS Small Development Grants \\xa0- Supports small projects in data science and scientific computing. Grant amounts vary ($285k split between all applicants).\\nThis builds a huge credibility and in the meantime, you\\'re paid a decent amount for the effort.\\nA great list of similar open source programs you can find on\\nGitHub .\\n10. API as a Service.\\nMost of the developers are not aware of this method. You can earn a passive income from your API.\\nAnother common term to refer to this is\\nAPI Monetization .\\nYou can try some popular API monetization platforms to publish, manage and monetize your APIs:\\nRapidAPI Hub\\n- One of the largest platforms for discovering and monetizing APIs, using subscription-based pricing models.\\nTyk\\n- open source API gateway that supports API management and monetization, with flexible deployment options.\\nApigee\\n- Google Cloud platform with API monetization and analytics.\\nPostman API Network\\n- Allows devs to publish APIs and use Postman’s ecosystem for collaboration.\\nYou can read the detailed guide on how to\\nEarn a Passive Income by Monetizing APIs as a Developer\\nby RapidAPI. It covers how to first build an API from scratch before selling it on\\xa0RapidAPI Hub.\\n11. Building a paid community.\\nThis is another underrated way to build decent money using your experience as a developer.\\nNewsletters are another kind of community but it\\'s generally one way of communication.\\nA community where members can talk and learn from each other is more useful. You can enable monthly or yearly subscriptions to avoid adding people who are not serious.\\nThis is just 1/3rd of the active channels\\nTrust me, a paid community of 500 members is very strong. I\\'ve been part of several paid communities and the difference is very clear.\\nMy community is public because I don\\'t like sharing my experience only with people who can pay, but at the same time, nobody can deny the value of a paid community.\\nI know it\\'s easier said than done.\\nThese are just basic important ideas and it can be very hard to find the right clients at first.\\nBut one single opportunity can change your life in a way you cannot even imagine. Take a leap and explore these methods to build a proper side income.\\nI hope at least one of these can help you.\\nHave a great day! Until next time :)\\nIf you loved this,\\nplease follow for more :)\\nThank you for reading,\\nAnmol\\n🥰\\nFollow Opire for more content like this.\\nOpire\\nFollow\\nOpire is a bounty platform for developers focused on open-source projects.
